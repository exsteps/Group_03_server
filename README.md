Aalborg University Medialogy Group 3 Semester 3 2018 <br /> Dice Racing Digital Board Game Server, Version 1

===============================

Welcome to the 2018 Medialogy 3 Group 3 Dice Racing Digital Board game! <br />
Built in Java for the AAU Medialogy Programming MiniProject.
This game is run in the console of the environment of which the files are opened.

------

This game will have players roll a die against each other to reach the final goal.

The rules are simple:

1: All players Start with 0 points. It is not possible to get less.

2: All players roll a die each round and the size of the die changes based on the number of players.
	Example: There are 4 players, so the dice the players roll has numberOfPlayers*2 sides = 8.
	
3: Whoever rolls the highest number, gets 1 point.
	Example: Player 3 rolls the highest number as the only player and, therefore gets 1 point.
	
4: If 2 or more players rolls highest, they all lose 1 point.
	Example: Player 2 and Player 4 both roll highest, so they both loose 1 point.
	
5: The player who reaches the score to win first, wins the game. (That score can be changed in the VariableClass)

------
