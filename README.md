Welcome to the 2018 Medialogy 3 Group 3 Dice Racing Digital Board game! <br />
Built in Java for the AAU Medialogy Programming MiniProject.

------

This game will have players roll a die against each other to reach the final goal.

The rules are simple:

1: All players Start with 0 points. It is not possible to get less.

2: All players roll a die each round and the size of the die changes based on the number of players.
	Example: there is 4 players, so the dice the players roll has 5 sides, from 1-5 (#Specify when we're done)
	
3: Whoever rolls the highest number, gets 1 one point.
	Example: Player 3 rolls the only 5, so he gets 1 point.
	
4: If 2 or more players rolls highest, they all lose 1 point.
	Example: Player 2 and Player 4 both roll highest with 4's, so they both loose 1 point.
	
5: The player who reach 10 points first wins the game.
